Liam Walsh



0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:1.80
Rohitash Chandra
Anyways so.
0:0:4.350 --> 0:0:4.510
Rohitash Chandra
Have.
0:0:0.510 --> 0:0:7.150
Liam Walsh
OK. What's it been? If anybody else wants to add some ask rude or something on top of that, I think that's a pretty good.
0:0:7.930 --> 0:0:12.490
Sreedevi Nandakumar
Sorry, so we need to define another problem, more specifically, right?
0:0:12.60 --> 0:0:13.980
Liam Walsh
I look it's it's, it's not so much.
0:0:26.40 --> 0:0:26.440
Sreedevi Nandakumar
OK.
0:0:13.590 --> 0:0:27.510
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, but you have three page proposal, right? So you don't want too many goals. Basically, I would be like, OK, maybe comparison of models and comparison of paradigms could be OK gold, you know.
0:0:26.850 --> 0:0:28.330
John D'Souza
Hmm so.
0:0:27.550 --> 0:0:34.150
Rohitash Chandra
OK, sets of gold and you can ask some questions around it. You know if you want.
0:0:36.990 --> 0:0:43.390
John D'Souza
But is it? Is it possible Rohit then that we refine our questions over the next couple of weeks as well like?
0:0:44.830 --> 0:0:44.870
John D'Souza
For.
0:0:45.840 --> 0:0:47.680
John D'Souza
So we could be a bit more generic.
0:0:40.760 --> 0:0:47.800
Rohitash Chandra
Questions over the next couple of weeks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You. I mean, you know, you're proposing.
0:0:52.300 --> 0:0:52.820
John D'Souza
OK.
0:0:55.780 --> 0:0:56.940
John D'Souza
Yeah, yeah.
0:0:49.10 --> 0:0:57.250
Rohitash Chandra
Your proposal can slightly change your goals, but it's a very short project, right? So yeah, I mean.
0:1:6.60 --> 0:1:6.180
John D'Souza
Hmm.
0:0:58.880 --> 0:1:28.760
Rohitash Chandra
I mean, frankly, I mean when they told me that these guys are doing project in six weeks, I was like, what the hell is going on in this city? You know, what's wrong with you people? But then people started accepting that idea. Right. And it's a short six weeks, and then they're like, no, but it's a group work and students are not allowed to do anything else but just work on this for 2025 hours a week. Then I was like, OK, fine. And couple of years back, I was doing this supervision.
0:1:29.560 --> 0:1:39.40
Rohitash Chandra
For the last couple of years then we found some really interesting reports. At the end of the six weeks which which caught me quite, you know, a surprise, but yeah.
0:1:39.880 --> 0:2:8.0
Rohitash Chandra
It's all about the proposal and if you change too much in the proposal then you won't be able to have interest in your part. So that's why you need to have some at least two strong concrete goals. So you could say that, OK, there's a third one, but at the end you could say, OK, this goal we were not able to fulfil this goal in the directions of future research. People always have some negative results around there.
0:2:19.860 --> 0:2:20.260
John D'Souza
Yes.
0:2:22.620 --> 0:2:22.740
Sreedevi Nandakumar
It.
0:2:9.360 --> 0:2:24.960
Rohitash Chandra
Stuff like that. But The thing is, like your project proposal or plan should define what each Member is doing in every week of the implementation, including your week one. Actually, what you have done and what we are going to do.
0:2:25.580 --> 0:2:35.180
Rohitash Chandra
And how those I know the gang chat or whatever type of company you wanna go, how does it actually?
0:2:36.540 --> 0:2:37.100
Rohitash Chandra
Address the goal.
0:2:38.430 --> 0:2:46.590
John D'Souza
So. So Rohit, on that note, what we've got is, so we've got, we've, we've prepared. I'm actually hearing my own echo.
0:2:48.320 --> 0:2:50.560
John D'Souza
But So what we've got is.
0:2:52.460 --> 0:3:25.260
John D'Souza
We we we've sort of had a had a project breakdown of tasks and stuff, right. So we've got it fairly detailed up to say next week about what what each each of us will be doing right first two weeks the the, the, the third week onwards we've got placeholders for sort of what we're trying to achieve definitely there right. But we haven't divid up tasks as to Sree, they will do this and Liam will will do this. What we've said is so we we've we've got milestones that said I could.
0:3:26.280 --> 0:3:36.200
John D'Souza
Show it to you briefly if you want to. Gura, I want to know is is this going to be sufficient or do we need to like for example, I'll show you.
0:3:37.900 --> 0:3:51.540
Rohitash Chandra
I'm in. Yeah, you don't need to have very technical, you know, workload goals in your proposal. Basically all you are having giving is like a paragraph where, like, you know again chart, something like that.
0:3:51.740 --> 0:3:53.620
John D'Souza
Yeah. Yeah. So we have a.
0:3:59.930 --> 0:4:1.130
John D'Souza
Mm hmm yeah.
0:3:52.810 --> 0:4:9.10
Rohitash Chandra
Technical things are for you to discuss after like people like me exit the meeting amongst yourself. Like, OK, we. Yeah. Which each Member will what each Member will do for the next week. You know, like somebody you will need to say OK.
0:4:13.420 --> 0:4:13.620
John D'Souza
Mm hmm.
0:4:19.420 --> 0:4:19.540
John D'Souza
Hmm.
0:4:10.930 --> 0:4:23.330
Rohitash Chandra
Somebody's doing deep learning models this and that. Somebody likes Python, so that person starts doing some of the implementation. You're sharing everything on GitHub, not you. That's the thing of the the project. It's all about.
0:4:34.690 --> 0:4:35.50
John D'Souza
Yeah.
0:4:39.520 --> 0:4:39.640
John D'Souza
Hmm.
0:4:24.320 --> 0:4:48.0
Rohitash Chandra
You trying to, you know, divide your work and learn the skills. Learn the strength of your partner. Nobody's trying to prove anything here. What we're trying to do is utilise who is good in whatever they are good in and kind of tell that be friend to your partners, to your Members that hey.
0:4:48.40 --> 0:4:52.320
Rohitash Chandra
I'm good in writing and let me just do the literature review, so you start. You put that as a task.
0:4:52.310 --> 0:4:52.430
John D'Souza
Hmm.
0:4:58.270 --> 0:4:58.470
John D'Souza
Mm hmm.
0:5:9.880 --> 0:5:10.480
John D'Souza
OK.
0:5:13.720 --> 0:5:17.440
John D'Souza
Hmm. Yeah. So. So no. Sorry.
0:4:53.480 --> 0:5:19.360
Rohitash Chandra
And within a week, you show your Members that, hey, I have written this message to you guys when I read and edit and the coding person is like, hey, let me do the linear model and why don't somebody does the LSTM model something like that and then compare it. But these are some of the ways you could address this situation. Yeah. And if this is not a yeah. Sorry. Yeah.
0:5:19.700 --> 0:5:21.420
John D'Souza
No, no, no. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Sorry.
0:5:27.850 --> 0:5:27.970
John D'Souza
Hmm.
0:5:21.430 --> 0:5:44.550
Rohitash Chandra
No, I just wanted to say this is not a cause to to learn thing and new things. You may learn little bit of new things like somebody wants to do at this in overleaf or there's a number of things. This is the project causes for you to apply existing things, right? So but unfortunately I would be frank that the UNSW don't really have that much of.
0:5:46.230 --> 0:5:50.950
Rohitash Chandra
Writing skills causes actually and scientific writing causes so.
0:5:51.650 --> 0:5:59.170
Rohitash Chandra
Students struggle in the writing bit so, and hence I also shared one of the videos I made about how to write basically.
0:5:59.730 --> 0:6:0.970
John D'Souza
Hmm, OK.
0:6:0.830 --> 0:6:5.990
Rohitash Chandra
Working on that further to make that into our but yeah, yeah.
0:6:7.500 --> 0:6:14.260
John D'Souza
So as a I'll just share this briefly with you Rohit, just to get your feet, so for example.
0:6:8.250 --> 0:6:14.730
Rohitash Chandra
So I thought I just share with you. OK, so for example.
0:6:15.950 --> 0:6:18.910
Rohitash Chandra
This is this is just a Excel exporter so.
0:6:15.300 --> 0:6:50.380
John D'Souza
This is this is just an Excel export of our plans. Our plan we're managing in GitHub using issues and projects, right. And I just exported it. So to give you an idea like our plan looks like this, we we for the first couple of weeks like what we've done is we've allocated each other to various tasks. Some are where we're all three are doing bits of it. Some are where one of us is doing. You know we've said Sridev we'll do this. John will do this that, that, that. So we haven't. So what our plan currently is we've got tasks allocated in various phases of the project.
0:6:51.180 --> 0:6:57.740
John D'Souza
But we are sort of OK till next week where we've said next week we each of us will focus on a certain thing, right.
0:6:59.100 --> 0:6:59.860
John D'Souza
But then.
0:7:1.260 --> 0:7:16.540
John D'Souza
We expect to to update the the the plan next week with further details about what people will do in the following weeks. So is that acceptable or are you expecting us to have allocated tasks all the way down for all six weeks right now?
0:7:16.310 --> 0:7:24.750
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, it should be. No. So this, I don't think it will fit in your proposal in any way. Right. The only way you can fit it is.
0:7:23.770 --> 0:7:24.930
John D'Souza
There's an image here.
0:7:26.270 --> 0:7:34.430
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, you need to have it as an image. And yeah, there's some tutorials about how to do that, and you may have to probably.
0:7:38.680 --> 0:7:38.720
John D'Souza
H.
0:7:35.950 --> 0:7:41.230
Rohitash Chandra
It's too detailed. That means too many lines. You can't fit all those things, right? So.
0:7:41.890 --> 0:7:45.250
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, you have to probably summarise this to.
0:7:46.80 --> 0:7:46.480
John D'Souza
The.
0:7:48.570 --> 0:7:48.850
John D'Souza
OK.
0:7:47.270 --> 0:7:54.830
Rohitash Chandra
Where they do I mean this is OK for your but understanding but to.
0:7:59.810 --> 0:8:0.290
John D'Souza
No.
0:7:56.150 --> 0:8:0.350
Rohitash Chandra
Put it if not again chart and it will take too much.
0:8:2.110 --> 0:8:7.750
Rohitash Chandra
But on the on the other hand, you can keep it in the appendix. You can put this in the appendix.
0:8:9.450 --> 0:8:10.770
Rohitash Chandra
Because there's no such proposal.
0:8:8.410 --> 0:8:36.970
John D'Souza
OK, so So what I've what I've seen Rohit is. So what we've done is we we broadly like if you can see the the the sort of pseudogen chart is on the left side of this, right. So the we what we did was we just said that we're going to do our sort of project management scheduling work using GitHub, right. So we've got GitHub issues when we've got GitHub and and it's all managed within a GitHub project. So GitHub provides us features, right.
0:8:37.290 --> 0:8:38.650
John D'Souza
Now when it comes to.
0:8:38.320 --> 0:8:40.240
Rohitash Chandra
I was still actually.
0:8:40.50 --> 0:8:40.370
John D'Souza
Actually.
0:9:2.550 --> 0:9:2.630
Rohitash Chandra
Hi.
0:8:42.330 --> 0:9:7.930
John D'Souza
GitHub gives a very clunky Gantt chart right? And they even have some add on tools like we've tried out the call Gantt, Gantt lab or whatever, but that that randomly sorts the issues in a in a in a decent way. So that's why we'll be, I don't know what the expectation is like for a Gantt chart I've.
0:9:8.570 --> 0:9:15.130
Rohitash Chandra
We don't want complicated or comprehensive gunshot, right? So I mean at the we need to be very, very.
0:9:13.790 --> 0:9:25.990
John D'Souza
So I can summarise this but yeah, so so broadly what we've done is like where where we've divided up our activities into the typical you know, the the crisp DM phases. So we've got like.
0:9:27.690 --> 0:9:40.250
John D'Souza
This is a high these are the high level phases. You could say, right? And we won't be doing a deployment. So what we've said is our deployment is basically the finalisation of our report, right.
0:9:42.940 --> 0:9:45.260
Rohitash Chandra
I couldn't put.
0:9:48.660 --> 0:9:51.220
Rohitash Chandra
The activity.
0:9:41.700 --> 0:9:53.180
John D'Souza
So I could put a Gantt chart at that high level to say, you know when these activities, but if you want to see assignees and stuff activities, this was the sort of.
0:9:53.640 --> 0:9:56.800
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, I mean that, I mean.
0:9:58.560 --> 0:9:59.920
John D'Souza
'Cause I have nifty like.
0:10:0.10 --> 0:10:2.290
Rohitash Chandra
We need, I mean to give a whole project.
0:10:7.80 --> 0:10:7.440
John D'Souza
Yeah.
0:10:9.890 --> 0:10:10.730
John D'Souza
Yeah. OK.
0:10:3.970 --> 0:10:19.850
Rohitash Chandra
Timeline. You don't really need a chart necessarily. You can even, yeah, show it as a table. Basically, it's just. Yeah, it's just, yeah, that it's not. Does it explicitly say in the proposal to give the chart? No, it just says a timeline, right.
0:10:21.570 --> 0:10:28.450
Rohitash Chandra
It says a list of they want a list of activity, yes, with a, with assignees and yeah, so.
0:10:21.980 --> 0:10:30.740
John D'Souza
This to they want a list of activities with a, with assignees, and, and they say if possible again chart.
0:10:35.200 --> 0:10:35.800
John D'Souza
OK, OK.
0:10:31.200 --> 0:10:39.360
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah. So this part you can put it in the appendix as it is and then summarise view and.
0:10:38.820 --> 0:10:39.420
John D'Souza
OK.
0:10:41.540 --> 0:10:41.980
Rohitash Chandra
OK, better.
0:10:40.830 --> 0:10:42.390
John D'Souza
OK, fair enough. Thank you.
0:10:43.990 --> 0:10:45.110
John D'Souza
You can do that too.
0:10:51.230 --> 0:10:51.390
John D'Souza
OK.
0:10:53.980 --> 0:10:57.60
Rohitash Chandra
What they needed to make a patrol.
0:10:52.790 --> 0:10:57.190
John D'Souza
So I think what we need is to be a bit more clearer on.
0:10:59.360 --> 0:10:59.600
Rohitash Chandra
Public.
0:11:9.540 --> 0:11:9.740
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah.
0:11:12.700 --> 0:11:13.20
Rohitash Chandra
You know.
0:10:58.260 --> 0:11:23.860
John D'Souza
I'll go a goal and questions are begin to do right because I I don't think we reached in our discussions a level of maturity to say you know to be as specific as to say that you know in literature like we gave that example that lstns have been used you know to to some extent in, in, in load forecasting environments.
0:11:25.540 --> 0:11:33.140
John D'Souza
But but the data sets have been, you know, American or whatever. And we want to try it out this way, I don't think.
0:11:33.340 --> 0:11:34.20
John D'Souza
I don't think we've.
0:11:33.690 --> 0:11:34.970
Rohitash Chandra
I don't think we as well.
0:11:37.920 --> 0:11:44.40
Rohitash Chandra
Return back to the back level of researcher so we don't have the source to say the level of difficulty so.
0:11:37.220 --> 0:11:47.340
John D'Souza
We've done that, that level of research, right, like so we we do have research to say these are the typical types of models that have been used and we are sort of proposing.
0:11:52.610 --> 0:11:52.890
Rohitash Chandra
Problem.
0:11:49.260 --> 0:12:4.900
John D'Souza
We thought to be position our problem more around like something like how like forecasting of electricity is is is demand is is complicated.
0:12:5.990 --> 0:12:6.870
John D'Souza
Because of the.
0:12:6.790 --> 0:12:9.830
Rohitash Chandra
Because it's a growing.
0:12:8.570 --> 0:12:13.570
John D'Souza
Growing up, So what we thought was something like this that that.
0:12:16.480 --> 0:12:17.520
John D'Souza
Oh, OK, OK.
0:12:11.510 --> 0:12:19.510
Rohitash Chandra
Something like that. Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. I would just giving an example, you can have those things as.
0:12:21.290 --> 0:12:23.730
Rohitash Chandra
Like a technical motivation, you could have more of.
0:12:22.940 --> 0:12:28.780
John D'Souza
Yeah, for business here. OK. So what we were saying? Yeah. OK.
0:12:26.0 --> 0:12:31.600
Rohitash Chandra
For business facilities or climate change perspective wire doing it.
0:12:35.60 --> 0:12:35.700
John D'Souza
OK.
0:12:33.240 --> 0:12:37.560
Rohitash Chandra
If you have better forecast, you're using less renewable energy, you could say.
0:12:39.320 --> 0:12:40.480
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah. So.
0:12:41.830 --> 0:12:42.390
John D'Souza
OK.
0:12:42.680 --> 0:12:45.0
Rohitash Chandra
It's it's all OK. Yeah, there's many ways.
0:12:44.40 --> 0:12:47.200
John D'Souza
OK, OK, you can. OK.
0:12:46.490 --> 0:12:48.490
Rohitash Chandra
You can, yeah.
0:12:55.90 --> 0:12:56.370
Rohitash Chandra
So we were thinking.
0:12:49.460 --> 0:12:57.180
John D'Souza
OK, I guess so. So we'll see what what feedback we get on our proposal. So we we were thinking more like Liam mentioned.
0:12:58.610 --> 0:13:0.330
John D'Souza
On on the idea of seeing.
0:13:1.670 --> 0:13:5.590
John D'Souza
Of of demonstrating, if at all you know whether.
0:13:8.490 --> 0:13:14.890
John D'Souza
The introduction of the the growing introduction of distributed energy.
0:13:18.230 --> 0:13:18.430
Rohitash Chandra
That.
0:13:17.430 --> 0:13:19.430
John D'Souza
Systems is.
0:13:19.430 --> 0:13:19.550
Rohitash Chandra
Yes.
0:13:21.650 --> 0:13:23.970
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, sure. Nothing.
0:13:25.530 --> 0:13:26.530
Rohitash Chandra
I have this price and.
0:13:44.170 --> 0:13:44.330
Rohitash Chandra
OK.
0:13:22.590 --> 0:13:48.910
John D'Souza
Shows us any has impacted demand like the fact that there's growing population is one thing, but then there's also from the point of view of the people managing the grid, right, we the what's, what's, what's making the predictability more complex we feel is potentially the fact that people are actually going off the grid.
0:13:50.290 --> 0:13:51.50
John D'Souza
Because.
0:13:53.230 --> 0:13:53.470
Liam Walsh
Hi.
0:14:1.590 --> 0:14:1.910
Liam Walsh
Jen.
0:13:52.300 --> 0:14:3.900
John D'Souza
So so as as pop population expands, people are going off the grid by by because not through through some renewable energy sources, but.
0:14:4.820 --> 0:14:10.660
John D'Souza
Do we see from data sets any trends or whatever I don't know.
0:14:11.960 --> 0:14:12.120
John D'Souza
Oh.
0:14:13.370 --> 0:14:27.810
Liam Walsh
Radish if. If I am correct and well, it's hard in the meeting. It's you're more worried about that. We've tested different data science principles with the data we've we have more than what the data will come up with at the end.
0:14:27.30 --> 0:14:27.990
John D'Souza
Will tell us.
0:14:29.610 --> 0:14:33.10
Liam Walsh
Is this project more bit more of going to say that?
0:14:33.870 --> 0:14:48.430
Liam Walsh
Well, you know, you went talking results, but we we want you to look at what you were saying as the best data science methods to get to the results through LTS. I'm short. I remember you just said Acnn network to the same data.
0:14:45.350 --> 0:14:56.710
Rohitash Chandra
Sorry, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll let's close out microphone then. I can't hear Liam actually, so I just switch my off my microphone in. Somebody can repeat me.
0:14:56.810 --> 0:14:57.210
Liam Walsh
OK.
0:14:59.30 --> 0:14:59.870
Liam Walsh
Can you hear me now?
0:15:1.990 --> 0:15:14.590
Liam Walsh
So yes, the the question is we have a set of theres and we have a a plan overall, but what the project is looking for is the methods researching the methods of which we use to run those models.
0:15:20.840 --> 0:15:21.40
John D'Souza
Mm hmm.
0:15:16.320 --> 0:15:41.680
Liam Walsh
As opposed to what the end result of any model would actually be is. That's generally how you're you see this going. So it's not so much whatever end products we get, it's that we said we've we wanted to test this particular scenario. We picked these methods because we've researched and they said that the this particular LTLSTM is the best method for what we think we're achieving are convolution networks or whatever.
0:15:43.40 --> 0:15:49.560
Liam Walsh
And the research is how well the the model go as opposed to what the end result is.
0:15:50.900 --> 0:16:5.460
Rohitash Chandra
Yes, you're not supposed to basically beat whatever the predictions are from the market regulator, right? Because they it's a multimillion dollar industry where they, they have people working on the.
0:16:3.970 --> 0:16:8.450
Liam Walsh
Yes. Wait, if we if I take it, if we beat them, we can start up our own company.
0:16:10.650 --> 0:16:10.730
John D'Souza
Mm.
0:16:8.810 --> 0:16:19.690
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, exactly. So. So it's a multi $1,000,000 industry and if people who are doing this for years or decades, right, so and they have.
0:16:18.740 --> 0:16:30.20
Liam Walsh
But when you're looking when you're looking at well, at the end of the day, it's America. When you're looking at American this, what you're looking at was all the exam, this particular model, this is going to examine. This is the result.
0:16:31.790 --> 0:16:32.390
Liam Walsh
Sorry for that.
0:16:34.490 --> 0:16:38.130
Liam Walsh
Supposed to get your children to stay like more than the end result.
0:16:38.750 --> 0:16:40.630
Rohitash Chandra
Did you hear hear leader?
0:16:39.980 --> 0:16:44.900
John D'Souza
No, Liam, you went offline. There's, I mean, your voice.
0:16:43.970 --> 0:16:48.970
Liam Walsh
I copy my voice. Maybe. Maybe the microphones can't pick up micro action, so I don't know.
0:16:50.360 --> 0:16:51.120
Liam Walsh
Can you hear me now?
0:16:50.790 --> 0:16:58.750
Rohitash Chandra
The problem with teams actually usually zoom is better, but the university wants to use this. What can we do? Yeah.
0:17:2.230 --> 0:17:5.310
Liam Walsh
To get back to the point or the point is when.
0:17:5.650 --> 0:17:5.930
Rohitash Chandra
What?
0:17:7.850 --> 0:17:15.370
Liam Walsh
You're marking this at the end. You're looking at us how we've approached it by getting the methods that we use as opposed to the end result.
0:17:20.40 --> 0:17:21.160
Liam Walsh
He's crashed again, has he?
0:17:20.730 --> 0:17:22.610
John D'Souza
Now, now, Rohit is frozen.
0:17:24.530 --> 0:17:27.410
Liam Walsh
Is that what everybody got from this apart from myself or?
0:17:28.850 --> 0:17:29.10
Liam Walsh
Yeah.
0:17:27.150 --> 0:17:33.150
John D'Souza
Yeah, I think I think now I think what you're saying is true and and maybe Liam, we need to talk a bit after this, yeah.
0:17:33.40 --> 0:17:33.200
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah.
0:17:32.210 --> 0:17:41.610
Liam Walsh
So so the ideas of what should I should I build the stuff you got is the way we should be going. These are the research we did. These are the models we're gonna go for For these reasons.
0:17:41.0 --> 0:17:42.160
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah. OK.
0:17:41.740 --> 0:17:42.700
Sreedevi Nandakumar
Yeah, yeah.
0:17:43.140 --> 0:17:43.900
Liam Walsh
Oh sorry I.
0:17:43.610 --> 0:17:50.250
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're you're you're thinking in the right, right track, Liam. I mean, we won't.
0:17:54.450 --> 0:17:55.770
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, no. Yeah.
0:17:48.750 --> 0:17:57.630
Liam Walsh
Yes, I think I I think when we started off last week, we were a bit more about the end result and I think this is more about the modelling, the modelling process more than the end result.
0:17:58.250 --> 0:17:59.490
Rohitash Chandra
Exactly, yes.
0:18:0.0 --> 0:18:0.480
John D'Souza
OK.
0:18:1.930 --> 0:18:2.210
Liam Walsh
OK.
0:18:1.500 --> 0:18:2.740
John D'Souza
OK, that sounds good.
0:18:4.130 --> 0:18:5.330
John D'Souza
Thank you for that. Yeah.
0:18:6.850 --> 0:18:9.650
John D'Souza
Were there any other?
0:18:9.690 --> 0:18:10.170
John D'Souza
Questions for.
0:18:12.500 --> 0:18:12.540
Rohitash Chandra
I.
0:18:8.940 --> 0:18:16.940
Liam Walsh
Well, the, the the last, the last question we had had to do with should we concentrate on NSW data, but I think that becomes a bit of relevant path for the conversation. Does it?
0:18:18.880 --> 0:18:19.280
Rohitash Chandra
I mean.
0:18:18.340 --> 0:18:20.340
Liam Walsh
Whatever module we take would be the model we go with.
0:18:29.30 --> 0:18:29.550
Liam Walsh
I think you have.
0:18:21.290 --> 0:18:29.730
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, because that new Southwest data has the temperature values right? And the other thing is like, should you get more data?
0:18:31.200 --> 0:18:36.720
Rohitash Chandra
And, but that's like getting outside of data. There's a lot of effort. You know how much time you use?
0:18:37.380 --> 0:18:37.980
Liam Walsh
Yes, OK.
0:18:38.690 --> 0:18:41.930
Rohitash Chandra
So I would be like because it's a short term project.
0:18:43.610 --> 0:19:1.650
Rohitash Chandra
It's like if you don't get outside data, there's no requirement you will not use any marks or something. I would basically utilise whatever is there, you know, unless you really know. It's like the moment you talk about climate data. I mean, I also do machine learning climate.
0:19:2.390 --> 0:19:2.510
John D'Souza
Hmm.
0:19:3.490 --> 0:19:4.330
Rohitash Chandra
Research as well so.
0:19:9.310 --> 0:19:10.430
John D'Souza
What is appropriate?
0:19:5.640 --> 0:19:11.800
Rohitash Chandra
There's a lot of uh data out of there and what is appropriate to ask.
0:19:18.890 --> 0:19:19.10
John D'Souza
Hmm.
0:19:11.840 --> 0:19:37.0
Rohitash Chandra
And how it aligns with your, you know time zone timestamps for the problem that you have. So there are a lot of things and actually there are some inconsistencies in the data as well in there. So some people have found and we'll just take the data as it is and whatever inconsistencies and stuff it's just reported as a limitation.
0:19:38.10 --> 0:19:44.370
Rohitash Chandra
The research you know, but tomorrow on Wednesday, basically you can ask Oliver.
0:19:45.670 --> 0:19:56.430
Rohitash Chandra
Who is the the CEO of this company and we will be there for an hour to talk to you about the data problems implications.
0:19:57.580 --> 0:20:0.500
Rohitash Chandra
So you cannot know this other data question, OK.
0:20:1.740 --> 0:20:2.300
John D'Souza
OK.
0:20:8.520 --> 0:20:9.120
John D'Souza
Yes.
0:20:6.350 --> 0:20:12.190
Rohitash Chandra
I mean, it's good to attend that live so that you can ask questions rather than seeing a video recording or.
0:20:13.550 --> 0:20:18.470
Rohitash Chandra
Questions or regards and you're like, oh, why didn't somebody else ask you?
0:20:21.350 --> 0:20:23.710
Rohitash Chandra
That happens. Yep, she did we.
0:20:24.60 --> 0:20:30.380
Sreedevi Nandakumar
Would you like us to specify what type of modelling are we using like long term or short term?
0:20:34.510 --> 0:20:35.30
Sreedevi Nandakumar
OK.
0:20:32.220 --> 0:20:39.100
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, that's entirely up to you. But I, like you want to look go hourly basis or daily basis, right?
0:20:38.760 --> 0:20:39.880
Sreedevi Nandakumar
Yep, Yep.
0:20:41.220 --> 0:20:51.220
Rohitash Chandra
And I would. My advice is like try to do multi step ahead prediction because you can do more analysis on this on different steps how the.
0:20:51.960 --> 0:20:54.240
Rohitash Chandra
Privacy is increasing, increasing stuff.
0:20:55.280 --> 0:20:59.760
Rohitash Chandra
So it it does not it? You can decide if you want to go.
0:21:3.510 --> 0:21:3.830
Sreedevi Nandakumar
OK.
0:21:1.210 --> 0:21:5.370
Rohitash Chandra
Stepwise or day ways you know that's something for you to think about.
0:21:6.40 --> 0:21:6.240
Sreedevi Nandakumar
Yeah.
0:21:6.890 --> 0:21:8.170
Rohitash Chandra
The other thing is like.
0:21:9.810 --> 0:21:21.690
Rohitash Chandra
Because it's anyways, it becomes a large model, a large data set. So because in so we try to visually use a smaller model, sometimes to smaller portion of the data.
0:21:23.130 --> 0:21:28.730
Rohitash Chandra
So that we have we run the model 30 times different.
0:21:28.770 --> 0:21:36.690
Rohitash Chandra
Experimental settings in the weights and biases of the neural network, the initial weights and stuff to get some sort of incidenties in the prediction.
0:21:37.800 --> 0:21:38.760
Rohitash Chandra
So sometimes.
0:21:39.990 --> 0:21:45.190
Rohitash Chandra
And if you do that, that is also can be a part of a goal or a partial goal.
0:21:47.500 --> 0:21:52.980
Rohitash Chandra
This I mean, and there's a lot of machine learning is doing at.
0:21:54.470 --> 0:21:59.350
Rohitash Chandra
Develop a model and you run it and you don't know how it will behave when you run it again.
0:22:1.90 --> 0:22:6.10
Rohitash Chandra
But it's just so large the data set that you don't have the capacity to run that model again.
0:22:7.390 --> 0:22:9.430
Rohitash Chandra
So resolve these issues.
0:22:24.90 --> 0:22:25.490
Sreedevi Nandakumar
Only I'm gonna mute.
0:22:27.460 --> 0:22:30.140
Liam Walsh
At this point, does anybody have any other questions? I'd like to ask.
0:22:32.230 --> 0:22:38.190
John D'Souza
No, I I think I'm OK. I think we need to regroup after this and make sure we.
0:22:37.460 --> 0:22:38.540
Liam Walsh
Yes, that's fine. That's fine.
0:22:43.500 --> 0:22:43.820
John D'Souza
Yeah.
0:22:37.440 --> 0:22:44.160
Rohitash Chandra
Yeah, you can take the rest of the session and just don't talk among yourself. What you're going to do in the coming week and.
0:22:44.960 --> 0:22:45.560
John D'Souza
OK.
0:22:44.840 --> 0:22:49.560
Rohitash Chandra
You know? Yeah, I'll be online if there's anything, just post it in the chat, eh?
0:22:50.270 --> 0:22:51.390
John D'Souza
Thanks Robert.
0:22:51.270 --> 0:22:53.670
Rohitash Chandra
Alright, take care. Bye bye. See you guys.
0:22:52.290 --> 0:22:53.770
John D'Souza
Cheers. OK bye.
0:22:53.700 --> 0:22:54.420
Liam Walsh
Thank you very much.
0:22:54.860 --> 0:22:55.300
John D'Souza
Bye.
0:22:54.820 --> 0:22:55.340
Sreedevi Nandakumar
Thank you.
0:22:59.320 --> 0:23:0.360
John D'Souza
OK guys.
0:23:1.420 --> 0:23:5.260
Liam Walsh
OK. Well listen, you may it may. It may sound like it.
0:23:1.710 --> 0:23:8.350
John D'Souza
I I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll put the I'll put the recording off. OK, right now.
0:23:10.140 --> 0:23:10.780
John D'Souza
Stopped.
