What is the high-level goal?
See over time what is the effect of Solar PV. Narrow down your focus – Energy load forecasting – big ecosystem; Within 4 – 5 weeks we can’t really work on the 
	more than 1 year – long term
Medium term – Weekly fortnightly and up to 1 year

See seasonality – People wake up in the morning – Up to 9 AM to 2.00 PM less use of energy; 3 t

Short term data – will be a good idea.
How will temperature affect energy forecasting?
How energy generated from the solar group panel will impact the energy forecasting?
What should be the independent variables we need to implement 4 different models for this aspect of the model?
Energy user need great forecasting
Seasonality Sarima model
Deep learning – model LSTM

Long term load forecasting will be much harder to do in the given time frame. We might need to consider other factors. 
	Temperature and environmental factors – BOM
A goal could be- 
  Whether temperature is a good predictor for load forecasting?
  Initially perform data exploration, check trends – box plots, scatter plots.


Good Jupyter story – Sonit will confirm it with other lecturers.

Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low energy-house- An example of an article.

When we see any data science project, we are interested in a good story. When we work in an industry, we need a good story around this. 

Implement 2 or three models and fill in the time for data exploratory analysis.
If there is a plot, do the commentary on the plot – Plot is an auxiliary tool to 

Presentation  

How energy changes month to month?

To do
Everyone – Have a look at the data and come up with a specific goal before our next meeting on 24th March


Next meeting 
Sunday 22nd March at 6 ‘O’ Clock
